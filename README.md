# Building-Systems-with-the-ChatGPT-API
Welcome to this course on building systems using the ChatGPT API.

Congratulations and thank you for getting to this short course. 
As we conclude the course, let's recap the main topics we covered. 
We went over details of how an LLM works, including subtleties like the 
tokenizer and why it can't reverse lollipop. 
We learned methods for evaluating user inputs to 
ensure the quality and safety of the system, 
processing inputs using both chain of thought reasoning and 
splitting tasks into subtasks with chain prompts, 
and checking outputs before showing them to users. 
We also took a look at methods for evaluating the system over 
time so as to monitor and improve its performance. 
 
Throughout the course, we also discussed the importance of 
building responsibly with these tools, ensuring that the 
model is safe and provides appropriate 
responses that are accurate, relevant and in the tone you want.
